Once upon a time, there was a country which was full of monster.
In the highest tower of the country, there lived a king of all monsters called Mephisto. 
He had the dream to rule the world.
In order to stop him, Arthur started his journey to save the world.

Arthur was on a mission to stop the evil ruler Mephisto and save the Kings daughter, who Mephisto had as a prisoner. On the first night of his four day journey, Arthur came across a traveler who wanted to help him save the princess. Together they set off towards Mephisto's castle!

The traveler was mysterious. His face was coverred with clothes, and he never told Arthur his name. However, one day, Arthur saw the traverller talking to a bird! The traveler finally commited that he was a magician named Merlin.

The magician was very powerful and he had many other magic skills like flying. The next day, he promised that he could fly to the tower together with Arthur.
