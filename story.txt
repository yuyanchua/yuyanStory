Once upon a time, there was a country which was full of monster.
In the highest tower of the country, there lived a king of all monsters called Mephisto. 
He had the dream to rule the world.
In order to stop him, Arthur started his journey to save the world.

Arthur was on a mission to stop the evil ruler Mephisto and save the King's daughter, who Mephisto had as a prisoner. On the first night of his four day journey, Arthur came across a traveler who wanted to help him save the princess. Together they set off towards Mephisto's castle!

The traveler was mysterious. His face was coverred with clothes, and he never told Arthur his name. However, one day, Arthur saw the traverller talking to a bird! The traveler finally commited that he was a magician named Merlin.

The magician was very powerful and he had many other magic skills like flying. The next day, he promised that he could fly to the tower together with Arthur. 

When they were flying to the tower, they suddenly triggered the alarms that were set around the tower. 
A huge army of monster came to intercept them, therefore they could not fly to the tower. 
However, they did not wanted to give up, so they continued their journey by foot.
After few years of difficult journey and several times of dying experience, they finally reached the tower. They challenged Mephisto to save the princess. 
However, princess came out with two twins and said that Mephisto had gave up on ruling the world and the princess had married to him. 
Futhermore, King had recognized their marriage, so there was no need to save the princess. Arthur and Merlin had come here for nothing.
Peace had come to the world once again.
